Preamble
========

Since the simulated processes don't have a page table register (research), I map the processes' pids to page tables in
a shared memory array.

Directory Structure
===================

Project Root
 |
 +-- child.c        (the main file for the child program)
 |
 +-- clock.c        (the main file for the clock library)
 |
 +-- clock.h        (the corresponding header file for clock.c)
 |
 +-- Makefile
 |
 +-- oss.c          (the main file for the oss program)
 |
 +-- memmgr.c       (the main file for the memory manager library)
 |
 +-- memmgr.h       (the corresponding header file for memmgr.c)
 |
 +-- README

Building
========

To build, run the following command:

$ make

Usage
=====

At any time, run the following command for help:

$ ./oss -h

The program will run with the assigned defaults if you run the following:

$ ./oss

To run in verbose mode to see what is happening internally, use -v:

$ ./oss -v

Interrupt the process with ^C on a terminal to stop the simulation.

Cleanup
=======

To clean up after a build, use the following command:

$ make clean
