Assignment 6

Preamble
========

Since the simulated processes don't have a page table register (research), I map the processes' pids to page tables in
a shared memory array.

User mode reads and writes are coarsely simulated. There is no data read/written, but a type called ptr_vm_t is used to
"point to" a location in simulated virtual memory.

Since no scheduling is simulated, oss really has no control over the children, so suspension is simulated in the
children when memmgr informs them of page faults.

Directory Structure
===================

Project Root

 +-- clock.c        (the main file for the clock library)
 |
 +-- clock.h        (the corresponding header file for clock.c)
 |

Building
========

To build, run the following command:

$ make

Usage
=====

At any time, run the following command for help:

$ ./oss -h

The program will run with the assigned defaults if you run the following:

$ ./oss

To run in verbose mode to see what is happening internally, use -v:

$ ./oss -v

Interrupt the process with ^C on a terminal to stop the simulation.

Cleanup
=======

To clean up after a build, use the following command:

$ make clean
